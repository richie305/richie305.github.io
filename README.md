- You control your Supabase project and data

## Supabase Setup

1. **Create a Supabase Project**

   - Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project
   - Get your Project URL and anon public key from Project Settings > API

2. **Create Tables**
   - Use the SQL Editor to create the following tables:

```sql
create table public.food_logs (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  type text,
  quantity text,
  stolen boolean,
  location text,
  timestamp bigint
);

create table public.bathroom_logs (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  location text,
  type text,
  size text,
  consistency text,
  timestamp bigint
);

create table public.favorites (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  label text,
  category text, -- 'food' or 'bathroom'
  type text,
  location text,
  size text,
  consistency text,
  food_type text,
  quantity text,
  stolen boolean
);
```

3. **Configure the App**
   - In `index.html`, set your Supabase URL and anon key:

```js
const SUPABASE_URL = "https://your-project.supabase.co";
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "your-anon-key";
const supabase = supabase.createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);
```
